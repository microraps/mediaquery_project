# mediaquery_project
practicing @media-queries / responsiveness 

Some description
This practice project
is more focused on the responsiveness of the
website. 

I created the website mobile-first, since it's
the modern way to design your website. 
It's also a good practice to go mobile first 
since it's easier to setup the desktop one once
the mobile version is fully functional.

One takeaway with learning how NAVS
work with mobile to desktop is that
there are lots of ways to make a responsive 
nav and on this project you'll see the 
heavy use of special SELECTORS like ( >, +, ~ )
